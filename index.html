      MS Dhoni, whose full name is Mahendra Singh Dhoni, is one of India’s most famous and successful cricketers. Born on 7 July 1981 in Ranchi, he became known for his calm personality, powerful batting, and excellent wicket-keeping skills. Dhoni captained the Indian cricket team and led India to major victories, including the 2007 T20 World Cup, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 Champions Trophy. He is admired for his leadership style and ability to stay cool under pressure, earning him the nickname “Captain Cool.” Although he retired from international cricket in 2020, he continues to play in the Indian Premier League for the Chennai Super Kings and remains a highly respected figure in the cricket world.
